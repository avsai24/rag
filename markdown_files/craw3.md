The inspection process becomes even more intricate during bottling. For example, a routine yet critical step, corking can introduce risks such as chips in the bottle’s mouth caused by excessive pressure. These chips sometimes result in glass shards falling into the wine, making precise inspection essential for maintaining product quality and safety. Fortunately, bottle inspection with Vision AI provides an automated solution to detect such problems in real time, ensuring that only better-quality bottles reach consumers. A recent recall in Western Australia, where glass shards were found in rosé wine bottles, highlights the importance of rigorous inspections. Such defects pose serious safety risks and can harm a winery’s reputation. This blog explores how glass bottle defect detection with Vision AI helps wineries tackle these challenges by offering a faster, more reliable way to inspect bottles. Understanding the Wine Production Process The wine manufacturing process consists of several crucial steps that must be carefully controlled to maintain the quality and integrity of the final product. Preparation: Before bottling, the wine undergoes fermentation and clarification to ensure it is free from unwanted solids or impurities. The winemaker monitors the wine’s maturity and taste to determine the optimal time for bottling, ensuring that the final product has the desired characteristics.Bottle Cleaning: Empty bottles must be thoroughly cleaned to remove any contaminants, dust, or foreign particles left over from manufacturing. This step is essential to prevent impurities from affecting the wine and ensure that only clean, contaminant-free bottles are used.Filling: After cleaning the bottles, the wine is carefully pumped into each bottle, ensuring the fill level is consistent across the production line. Proper fill levels are essential for maintaining product consistency and preventing issues like overfilling or underfilling, which could affect the wine’s quality.Corking or Capping: Once the bottles are filled, they are sealed with corks or screw caps to preserve the wine’s freshness and prevent oxidation. Proper sealing is crucial, as any air exposure can alter the wine’s flavor and reduce its shelf life. Accurate corking or capping is essential to maintain the integrity of the wine.Capsular Application and Labeling: Capsules are applied to cover corks or screw caps, adding a layer of protection and enhancing visual appeal. Bottles are labeled with essential branding and information, ensuring they meet marketing and consumer standards. This step ensures that each bottle is ready for distribution and sale. Wine Bottle Inspection Challenges in the Production Process The process of inspecting wine bottles is crucial to ensuring product safety and quality, but several challenges make it a complex task, especially when Speed of Production: High-speed bottling lines pose a significant inspection challenge. The faster the production, the more difficult it is to inspect every bottle thoroughly. Bottles are often moving at such high speeds that even the most skilled inspectors can miss defects, leading to overlooked issues in the final product. Contaminant Detection: Micro-level contaminants are difficult to spot during inspection. They are often invisible to the naked eye but can pose serious risks to consumer health and wine quality if undetected. Labeling Errors: Ensuring labels are correctly placed and undamaged is a challenge. Misaligned, wrinkled, or damaged labels not only affect the presentation of the product but can also confuse consumers or damage the winery’s brand. Inspections must detect such issues in real-time to ensure a consistent presentation.

Advancing Intelligence with Edge Learning for Computer Vision Applications ImageVision.ai > Blog > Advancing Intelligence with Edge Learning for Computer Vision Applications Advancing Intelligence with Edge Learning for Computer Vision Applications Vathslya Yedidi December 23, 2024 The abundance of connected devices and the increasing demand for real-time intelligent systems have exposed critical limitations in traditional cloud-based Computer Vision architecture. These systems often struggle with latency introduced by data transfer to remote servers, bandwidth constraints imposed by high-resolution visual data, privacy concerns arising from transmitting sensitive information, and scalability challenges associated with managing a growing number of devices. Edge Learning for Computer Vision offers a compelling solution by deploying Machine Learning models directly onto edge devices, enabling faster, more secure, and more efficient processing. Through bringing computation closer to the data source, Edge Learning in Computer Vision addresses these challenges directly, opening new possibilities for Computer Vision applications. In this blog, we will explore Edge Learning, the challenges it overcomes, and how it transforms real-world applications through compelling use cases. What is Edge Learning? Edge learning refers to the process of deploying and executing Machine Learning models directly on edge devices, such as smartphones, IoT gadgets, cameras, and drones. Instead of sending data to the cloud for processing, edge devices perform computations locally. This shift from centralized cloud processing to decentralized edge processing has significant implications. By processing data locally, Edge Learning for Computer Vision minimizes the dependency on centralized cloud systems, leading to reduced latency, conserved bandwidth, and strengthened data privacy. Consequently, Edge Learning in Computer Vision is particularly well-suited for applications demanding real-time responses, efficient use of network resources, and enhanced data security. The Role of Edge Computing in Addressing Computer Vision LimitationsComputer Vision applications frequently involve real-time high-dimensional data analysis, such as images and videos. This presents several key challenges that Edge Learning is uniquely positioned to address: Latency Issues: Processing delays can significantly affect latency-sensitive applications like autonomous navigation, robotics, and real-time surveillance. Traditional cloud-based systems introduce latency due to the time required to transmit data to remote servers and receive processed results. Edge Learning mitigates this latency by performing computations locally on the device, enabling near real-time responses crucial for these time-critical applications. Bandwidth Constraints: High-resolution visual data requires substantial bandwidth for transmission to the cloud. These bandwidth constraints can severely impact performance in scenarios with limited or intermittent network connectivity, such as remote monitoring, mobile deployments, or industrial IoT. Edge Learning in Computer Vision addresses this challenge by processing data locally, drastically reducing bandwidth usage, and enabling operation in constrained network environments. Privacy and Security Concerns: Transmitting sensitive visual data, such as facial recognition data, medical images, or surveillance footage, to centralized servers raises significant privacy and security concerns. Edge Learning for Computer Vision enhances privacy and reduces vulnerabilities by processing data locally on the device, minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. This is particularly important in applications where data confidentiality is paramount, such as healthcare and law enforcement. Scalability Challenges: Number of connected devices generating visual data increases, centralized cloud infrastructures face significant scalability challenges. Edge Learning in Computer Vision offers a more scalable and cost-effective solution by distributing the computational load across numerous edge devices. This decentralized approach avoids overloading central servers and allows for more efficient resource utilization as the number of deployed devices grows. Use Cases for Edge Learning in Computer Vision Edge Learning is changing various industries by enabling practical and innovative Computer Vision applications. The following examples illustrate its impact on Edge Learning in Computer Vision across diverse sectors: Smart Surveillance: Urban areas increasingly rely on public safety and security surveillance systems. Traditional centralized systems, which transmit video feeds to remote servers for analysis, suffer from latency and high bandwidth consumption. Edge-enabled cameras address these limitations by analyzing video streams locally, enabling real-time detection of unusual activities, object recognition, and other critical events. For example, a smart surveillance system deployed in a shopping mall can instantly identify theft or suspicious behavior and alert security personnel, even without constant cloud connectivity, improving response times and enhancing security. Healthcare Imaging: Edge learning in healthcare, particularly in remote and underserved areas, by enabling point-of-care diagnostics. Portable medical diagnostic devices equipped with edge processing can analyze images locally, providing immediate feedback to clinicians and eliminating the need for data transfer to external servers. For instance, a handheld ultrasound device can analyze images on-site, enabling rapid diagnosis and treatment decisions, particularly in critical care scenarios or remote field hospitals where immediate access to specialists is limited. This dramatically reduces diagnostic delays and improves patient outcomes. Autonomous Vehicles: Autonomous vehicles operate in highly dynamic environments, requiring split-second decisions for safe navigation. Cloud-based systems introduce unacceptable latency, which can compromise safety. Edge learning enables these vehicles to process sensor data, including images, LiDAR, and radar data, locally and in real-time. For example, a self-driving car can instantly detect pedestrians, traffic signals, and road obstacles, ensuring safe navigation even in areas with poor or no network connectivity. This real-time processing is essential for collision avoidance and safe autonomous operation. Retail Analytics: Retailers increasingly leverage Edge Learning to enhance customer experiences, optimize store operations, and improve inventory management. Edge-powered cameras and sensors can track store customer behavior, analyze product engagement, and monitor inventory levels in real-time without transmitting sensitive data to the cloud. For instance, “smart shelves” can identify low stock levels or out-of-stock products and notify staff automatically, ensuring efficient inventory replenishment and improved customer satisfaction. This also enables retailers to analyze customer traffic patterns and optimize store layouts for better product placement and sales. Edge Learning vs. Traditional Deep Learning: A Comparative AnalysisTo fully appreciate the advantages of Edge Learning, it is essential to compare it with traditional cloud-based Deep Learning approaches. The following table summarizes the key differences: Feature Traditional Deep Learning (Cloud-Based) Edge Learning Processing Location Centralized servers (cloud or on-premises data centers) Decentralized edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices) Latency High, due to data transmission to and from remote servers and processing delays Low, enabling near-instantaneous response times Bandwidth Usage High, requiring continuous data uploads for processing Minimal, as data processing occurs locally Data Privacy Lower, as data is transmitted and stored on external servers Higher, as sensitive data remains on the device Hardware Requirements High-performance computing infrastructure (e.g., GPUs, specialized hardware) Optimized for resource-constrained devices (e.g., CPUs, specialized edge AI accelerators) Typical Use Cases Large-scale data processing, model training, computationally intensive tasks Real-time applications, inference at the edge, context-aware processing Network Dependency Requires reliable network connectivity Can operate offline or with intermittent connectivity Model Updates Easier centralized model updates and management More complex distributed model updates and management Conclusion Edge Learning represents a significant advancement in Computer Vision, addressing critical limitations of traditional cloud-based approaches. Enabling local processing on edge devices offers significant latency, bandwidth efficiency, privacy, and scalability advantages. As connected devices grow, Edge Learning will be increasingly important in enabling innovative and practical applications across diverse industries. Future research and development efforts will focus on optimizing model compression techniques, developing efficient hardware architectures for edge devices, and addressing challenges related to model updates and management in distributed environments.

Customer Churn Customer retention is the most critical need for any business today The cost of acquiring a new customer can be much higher than that of retaining an existing customer. Increasing customer retention rates by a mere 5% could increase profits by 25% to 95%. Customer churn reflects how fast customers are leaving and creating a dent in your pocket. It’s a brutally honest metric that relates whether you have a viable business model as high churn hinders your potential for growth and hence an incredibly important dimension for any business. Customer churn might seem like it has a marginal effect on your monthly recurring revenue (MRR), but once churn gets out of control it can topple your growth and your business will eventually die. Reasons for Customer Churn are:Churn can be divided into Active and Passive. You need to identify which are the key points in your customer lifetime cycle where customers stop buying (or switch from) your service / product. Type of Churn can be classified into: Why we built this Accelerator?

Transport Cost Optimizer Challenges in Transport Cost Optimization In today’s competitive business environment, businesses are faced with low margins, pressure on volumes and volatile fuel prices. At the same time, they are constantly looking for the most efficient way to transport goods from a pick-up point to delivery location. Inefficient routing wastes minutes, miles and money, leaving on-time arrivals and important elements of customer satisfaction to chance. In-house systems for commercial and logistical operations often lack dynamic optimization because of the complexity of calculations that are needed. Transport optimization is valuable for many organizations as it can increase productivity and improve efficiency. Can a dynamic transport cost optimization solution address these challenges? From a technical perspective, traditional routing and scheduling applications use batch planning algorithms to create an optimal set of routes for each day’s deliveries. Running groups of orders through a batch solver allows many alternatives to be considered and, in this way, provides better, more optimized solutions than a manually produced solution. The classical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous example in the study of route optimization in the field of computer science. Route planning has always been a major interest of study due to the nature of the topic which covers many industries. Transportation pathways, flight routes, travelers, delivery services and many more applies TSP which means there is a need for a pre-planned route schedule to ensure an optimized travelling has been performed. Dynamic transport cost optimization improves the timing and routing over that of the regular batch model with real time adjustments and Demand-driven profitability. For transport this implies that the trend is moving from focusing on cost with enough capacity towards service in conditions of tight capacity. For businesses, this means both embracing adaptive planning and taking a forward-thinking approach Transport Cost Optimizer Our TCO has been built ground up to provide businesses with an intelligent planning suite that generates optimal & profitable delivery routes along with an efficient resource utilization plan (fleet, drivers, containers etc.). TCO supports planners by:Optimally distributing orders to available vehiclesSuggesting the best sequence of stopsCalculating optimized driving routesAll while considering relevant restrictions and customer preferences Solution Features Dynamic route optimizationConsider restrictions and constraintsSeamless integration with existing systemsAccommodate multiple fleet options Business Benefits Boost EfficiencyReduce Transport CostsImprove Customer ServiceGain Visibility and have Better ControlWhile companies with small fleets typically save between 10% and 15%, companies with larger fleets benefit from savings of 25% or more.

Master Data Management Achieve Single View of Customer by implementing Customer Master Data Management Master data management (MDM) is the core process used to manage, centralize, organize, categorize, localize, synchronize and enrich master data according to the business rules within sales, marketing and operational strategies of an organization. Our Customer Master Data Management Solution specializes in aggregating Customer records across disparate systems to create a golden record. This record when stitched with other customer details helps in creation of a customer data hub or a customer 3600 view. Why we built this Accelerator? Master Data Management (MDM) solution creates a centralized repository of a client’s master or golden records. Our solution leverages multi-domain MDM and hosts the database storing cleansed golden records.Master Data Management systems vary widely between organizations, and the type of deployment will depend on the core business, corporate structure and company goals. There are four common MDM implementation approaches: Registry, Coexistence, Consolidation, and Transaction/ Centralization. 1 A Registry type of approach can be used to analyze the data from many source systems spread across the world while avoiding the risk of overwriting information in the source systems and avoid potential compliance failure or other regulatory repercussions (which may vary from country to country) that could occur if source data is changed. Facebook campaign 2 A Consolidation type of approach can be used to pull master data from several existing systems and channel it into a single managed managed data hub. This data can then be cleansed, matched and integrated to offer a complete single record for one or more master data domains. Hubs are inexpensive and quick to set up, providing a fast and efficient way to facilitate enterprise-wide reporting and analytics. Facebook campaign 3 In the Co-existence type of approach, the data is mastered in source systems and then synchronized with the hub, so data can coexist harmoniously and offers a single version of the truth. The quality of master data is improved, and access is faster. Reporting is also easier as all master data attributes are in a single place. Links centrally governed data back to the source systems. Facebook campaign 4 In Transaction/centralized solution approach the master data is always accurate and complete while security and visibility policies at a data attribute level can be supported by the Transaction style hub. It benefits in having a centralized set of master data for one or more domains. Facebook campaign Customer MDM to achieve single view of customer is follows Consolidation implementation. What can be achieved by Customer Data Platforms can be nimbly achieved with our solution. Solution Accelerator Key components of the solution are:Data Discovery: Automatic discovery of the attribute type. Eg: First name, Last name, Phone no., email etc.Data Wrangling: State of the art data wrangling techniques involve spell checks, phonetics, abbreviations, geolocation etc. to generate additional attributes.Data Rationalization: Golden record generation by merging multiple records and using survivorship rules based on information gathered, timestamp etc.Data Clusters: Automatic clustering of information which can be leveraged by marketing teams to create targeted campaigns.Data Quality: Generate useful insights into quality of data to improve your business process efficiency.

Fill Level Inspection with Vision AI in Bottles for Consistent Quality ImageVision.ai > Blog > Fill Level Inspection with Vision AI in Bottles for Consistent Quality Fill Level Inspection with Vision AI in Bottles for Consistent Quality Vathslya Yedidi December 9, 2024 Manufacturing processes across industries, from raw material handling to electronics production, rely heavily on quality control to ensure uniformity in products meeting the same specifications. This practice is key to building a brand’s reputation, fostering customer loyalty, and maximizing profits. Accurate fill level monitoring is essential in various industries like pharmaceuticals, beverages, chemicals, food processing, cosmetics, and household products, where precision directly impacts quality, safety, and profitability. Underfilled bottles can lead to customer dissatisfaction and legal consequences, while overfilled products result in financial losses. Traditionally, quality assurance for fill levels involves routine inspections by trained staff. While this method is widely used, it is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently subjective, as individual assessments can vary despite standardized training. Many manufacturing sectors have turned to automated systems powered by Vision AI to address these limitations. Using cameras and image processing, these systems monitor defects and inconsistencies in production lines, offering benefits such as reduced human bias, lower labor costs, faster processing times, and minimized human contact, which helps prevent contamination. In this blog, we will explore the significance of Fill Level Inspection with Vision AI in Bottles, the challenges of traditional methods, and how Vision AI improves quality control in industrial manufacturing processes. What is Fill Level Monitoring in Bottles for Quality Control? Fill level monitoring refers to inspecting containers, such as bottles, to ensure they are filled to specified volume levels. This systematic process involves determining whether a container’s liquid level is within acceptable thresholds recognized by industry standards. In manufacturing, liquid level detection in bottles and containers is critical for identifying underfilled or overfilled products and maintaining consistency across production lines. Key Role of Fill-Level Monitoring in Automated Quality Assurance Fill-level monitoring is essential in modern manufacturing to deliver precision and reliability in production processes. Quality Control: Vision AI inspection systems improve product quality management by providing instantaneous, objective measurements of liquid fill levels. This eliminates human error and ensures consistent, reliable quality checks across production lines. Regulatory Precision: In highly regulated industries such as pharmaceuticals, beverages, and food production, automated fill level monitoring is essential. These systems guarantee that every container meets exact regulatory specifications, providing verifiable documentation of compliance with strict quality standards. Operational Optimization: Real-time fill-level Inspection with Vision AI generates valuable data that enables manufacturers to detect and correct filling inconsistencies instantly, reduce product waste, minimize production line interruptions, and optimize manufacturing processes with data-driven insights. Economic Impact: Automated inspection systems directly reduce costs by preventing overfilling and underfilling. They minimize material waste, reduce the risk of product recalls, and help maintain consistent product volumes that protect profit margins. Advanced Algorithms Integration: Modern fill-level monitoring leverages Computer Vision algorithms and high-speed sensors to deliver unprecedented accuracy and speed in quality assurance. Challenges in Fill-Level Inspection Across Industries Fill-level inspection is crucial in maintaining product quality and safety across industries. However, real-world scenarios present challenges that manufacturers must address to ensure accurate and efficient monitoring: Dealing with Transparent or Opaque Containers In industries like beverages and pharmaceuticals, containers can be clear, tinted, or completely opaque (e.g., amber bottles). Inspecting fill levels in opaque bottles is particularly challenging as the liquid is not visible to standard sensors or visual inspection systems. Foaming in Carbonated or Viscous Liquids Carbonated beverages or foamy products can create bubbles that obscure the fill level. Similarly, viscous liquids such as syrups or creams may settle unevenly during high-speed filling, complicating accurate level detection. Variations in Bottle Sizes and Shapes Packaging diversity, such as irregularly shaped bottles or varying container sizes, requires flexible inspection systems that can adapt to different configurations without compromising accuracy. Inconsistent Liquid Flow Rates Changes in liquid flow rates during production, caused by equipment malfunctions or variations in fluid properties, can lead to inconsistent fills, making inspections more complex. High-Speed Line Operations Modern manufacturing demands rapid production lines to meet high output requirements. Inspecting fill levels accurately at high speeds is difficult as it requires real-time data analysis and immediate adjustments to avoid disruptions. Impact of Environmental Factors Lighting, temperature fluctuations, and even vibration on production floors can interfere with Vision AI system’s performance. For instance, poor lighting can affect camera-based inspections, leading to false positives or missed defects. Product Adherence to Bottle Walls Certain products, like oils or sauces, can cling to the sides of bottles, giving the appearance of an incorrect fill level during inspection. This often leads to rejections or unnecessary adjustments. Regulatory Compliance Industries like pharmaceuticals and food must adhere to strict regulatory standards for fill levels. Ensuring compliance while minimizing waste and maintaining efficiency poses significant challenges, especially when transitioning from manual to automated inspection systems.Defining the Process of Fill-Level Inspection Using Computer Vision Integrating Vision AI systems offers a robust solution to address the challenges in fill-level monitoring. These systems use image processing and Computer Vision algorithms to assess fill levels accurately across various container types and production environments. The process of fill-level inspection with Computer Vision is as follows: Grayscale Conversion and Noise Reduction The process begins by converting the input image to grayscale, simplifying it by removing color information. This step reduces computational complexity while retaining the essential details needed for analysis. Gaussian blur is applied to further prepare the image for accurate edge detection. This smoothing technique minimizes noise and enhances the clarity of edges, ensuring a reliable foundation for subsequent steps. Edge Detection Using the Canny Algorithm After preprocessing, the Canny edge detection algorithm is applied. This method identifies significant edges in the grayscale image, highlighting boundaries such as the liquid level in a container. The algorithm prepares the image for precise contour detection by focusing on these prominent features. Contour Detection and Plotting With the edges highlighted, the next step is identifying and mapping contours within the image. Contours are closed shapes or boundaries that delineate distinct regions. This step isolates critical features, such as the liquid surface or bottle structure, providing a clear visual framework for analysis. Setting a Fill Level Threshold A fill-level threshold is established to define acceptable regions within the container. This threshold acts as a benchmark, specifying the expected liquid level. Comparing the detected features against this reference, the system determines whether the fill level meets the required standard. Region of Interest (ROI) Masking To focus on the analysis, a mask is applied to isolate the region of interest. Areas outside the defined threshold are excluded, ensuring only relevant parts of the image, such as individual bottles or the liquid surface, are analyzed.
